# hello-world

Hello world,

I'm a programmer living in the Toronto area, my favourite languages to work with are C, C++, Javascript and Python. I post up a lot of the personal projects I work on here, and if you see something thats interesting to you, feel free to collaborate or download it for your own purposes.

Happy coding!
